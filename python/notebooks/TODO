Correctness of the base k-means algorithm 

1- Compare the results with explicit initialization with scikit-learn kmeans
2- Check the scikit-learn code and improve your version, if necessary
3- Verify the results of improved code (like in step 1)

4- Extend your kmeans to cop-kmeans
5- Verify the correctness by comparing to the two available versions

6- Implement in Java
7- Compare with a kmeans code in java (for improvements in DS, etc.)
8- Verify the correctness by comparing to the three algorithms that you have 

9- Implement in C++
10- Compare with a kmeans code in C++ (for improvements in DS, etc.)
11- Verify the correctness by comparing to the four algorithms that you have
