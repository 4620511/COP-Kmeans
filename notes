- Embedding an svg image in github markdown needed a trick that I
  learned from this stackoverflow answer:
  http://stackoverflow.com/a/16462143
  (One should make a branch called 'gh-pages' and then links to svg
  image via github.io)

- TODO: add the algorithm to the readme page as an svg. dvisvgm seems
  to be a nice tool to convert latex to svg
