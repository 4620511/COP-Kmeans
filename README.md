# copkmeans
An implementation of cop-k-means algorithm

This is an implementations of the *Constrained K-means Algorithm*,developed by Wagstaff et al. according to the description of algorithm presented in [].

\begin{align*}	  
\textsc{cop-kmeans}(\mathit{data set D, must-link constraints Con} \subset D \times D, \mathit{cannot-link constraints} \mathit{Con}_{=} \subset D \times D

\end{align*}
