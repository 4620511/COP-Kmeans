# cop-kmeans
An implementation of cop-kmeans algorithm

This is an implementations of the *Constrained K-means Algorithm*,
developed by Wagstaff et al. according to the description of algorithm
presented in [[1][1]].

## Why did I implement it?

In 2013-14, I was working on developing an integer linear programming
formulation for an instance of the constrained clustering problem. The
approach that I chose was *Branch-and-Price* (also referred to as
column-generation). 

In the initialization step of my algorithm, I needed another algorithm
that can produce solutions of reasonably good quality very
quickly. The algorithm **cop-kmeans** turned out to be exactly what I
was looking for.
