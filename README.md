# cop-kmeans
An implementation of cop-kmeans algorithm

This is an implementations of the *Constrained K-means Algorithm*, developed by Wagstaff et al. according to the description of algorithm presented in [[1][1]]. 

## Why did I implement it?

In 2013-14, I was working on developing an integer linear programming
formulation for an instance of the constrained clustering problem. The
approach that I chose was *Branch-and-Price* (also referred to as
column-generation). In the initialization step of my algorithm, I
needed another algorithm that can produce solutions of reasonably good
solutions very quickly. **cop-kmeans** turned out to be what I was
looking for.
