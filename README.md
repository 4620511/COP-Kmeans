# copkmeans
An implementation of cop-k-means algorithm

This is an implementations of the *Constrained K-means Algorithm*, developed by Wagstaff et al. according to the description of algorithm presented in [[1][1]]. 

I implemented this algorithm since I use it in an initialization step in my work on constrained clustering [[2][2]].
